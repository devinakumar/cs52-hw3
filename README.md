#README for Homework 3: Part 1
This repository contains code for a sticky note app in React.  Once the user hits "New Note", the app generates a new sticky note with the user's given title in the input bar.  The sticky note only displays the title and whatever content is given to it.  At the beginning, there is no content, so the note only displays the title.  Once the user clicks the pencil, a text box appears in which the user can enter text that will be displayed in markdown.  If the user clicks the trashcan icon, the note will go away.  If the user clicks the arrow icon, the user can drag the note.  What worked really well for me in this assignment was using flexboxes for everything.  I made pretty much every item on the page as part of a flexbox, which really simplified the layout/making things line up.  One of the the things that I attempted that didn't work was that I originally did not use flexboxes to surround every component of my note, but then centering all of the components within the note became incredibly difficult, so I created flexboxes for almost everything.  For extra credit, I restyled the sticky notes and page itself.
